While my previous school provided a wealth of opportunities for me to explore and develop my interests, my current school falls short in this aspect.</p>
            <p id="matter">Despite this, I am grateful for my previous school for giving me the chance to participate in Student Government, Class Representative, etc. These experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded individual and helped me grow in ways I never thought possible.</p>

            <p id="matter">I am writing to bring to your attention that most high schools in India do not provide the opportunity for students to participate in STEM research. Despite my interest in these fields, I have not had the opportunity to gain research experience in a lab setting.</p>
            <p id="matter"> I would like to request that my application be considered without the requirement for STEM research experience. I have demonstrated my passion for STEM through my coursework and extracurricular activities, and I am eager to continue my studies in these fields in college.

            <p id="matter">At last, I would share something which I didn't shared in the application. As a student in 10th standard, I unfortunately found myself becoming easily distracted, which resulted in lower marks than I had hoped for. Through this experience, I have come to realize the importance of staying focused and motivated in order to achieve my goals. I have learned that it is essential to prioritize my studies and to make the most of my time in order to succeed. I know that in the future I will make sure to avoid distractions and to stay on track, so that I can achieve the success that I am capable of. This experience has been a valuable learning opportunity for me and I am determined to not repeat the same mistake again.</p>
